Amp: Atomistic Machine-learning Package
=======================================

`Amp <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp>`_ is an open-source package designed to easily bring machine-learning to atomistic calculations.
This project is being developed at Brown University in the School of Engineering, primarily by **Andrew Peterson** and **Alireza Khorshidi**,
and is released under the GNU General Public License.

This is a relatively new project, so things are constantly changing!
Please see the project's `git repository <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp>`_ for the latest version and news.

(Note that Amp is built off of our previous project, Neural. You may still find Neural at our `bitbucket page <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/neural>`_.)
