Convergence plots
----------------------------------

You can use the tool called `amp-plotconvergence` to help you examine the output of an Amp log file. Run `amp-plotconvergence -h` for help at the command line.

You can also access this tool as `plot_convergence` from the `amp.analysis` module.

There are several other plotting tools within this module, including ones for making parity plots and for examining the sensitivity of the model output to the model parameters.
